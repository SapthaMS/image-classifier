## image-classifier
The model selected for image classification is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) developed using TensorFlow's Keras Sequential API. This architecture consists of three Conv2D layers, each followed by ReLU activation and MaxPooling layers to reduce spatial dimensions. The model incorporates two dense layers with ReLU activation, a dropout layer with a 20% dropout rate for regularization, and a final dense layer with softmax activation for output class representation. The training procedure involves the loading and preprocessing of images, normalization of pixel values, and division of the dataset into training and testing sets. Throughout the 25 epochs of training with a batch size of 64, a 20% validation split is employed for monitoring. The training progress is depicted through accuracy and loss plots, which are saved for later analysis. Key findings encompass the accuracy on the test set, offering an overall evaluation of the model's performance. Moreover, the evaluation phase provides insights into the model's generalization ability, and predictions on the test set are stored in a CSV file for in-depth examination. To enhance the model, suggestions include experimenting with hyperparameters, potential data augmentation, and the consideration of additional metrics such as precision and recall. Finally, it is advisable to save the trained model for future applications or deployment.
